# Asset Server Service

The asset server service initializes an asset server to serve compiled assets to the testing environment. An express server will be launched for static sites. For all non-static sites a webpack-dev-server will be launched.

## Options

The assert server options are configured via the [test runner CLI options](../about#options).

### locale

Note: The locale will only be applied when providing a webpack configuration. The locale will not be used for `site` configuration.

An optional locale that will be passed into the webpack configuration as an environment variable.

Type: `string`

Required: `false`

Default: `en`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --locales en-US"
}
```

### assetServerPort

The port the service will be hosted on.

Type: `number`

Required: `false`

Default: `8080`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --assetServerPort 8081"
}
```

### site

A relative path to a directory of static assets. If provided, an express server will be launched to serve the directory assets.

Note: The `site` configuration option will take precedence over `webpackConfig` if both are provided.

Type: `string`

Required: `false`

Default: `undefined`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --site ./build"
}
```

### theme

Note: The theme will only be applied when providing a webpack configuration. The theme will not be used for `site` configuration.

An optional theme that will be passed into the webpack configuration as an environment variable.

Type: `string`

Required: `false`

Default: `terra-default-theme`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --themes terra-default-theme terra-lowlight-theme"
}
```
